# My Resume

- Within this repo lies the code of my digital Resume. 

I used simple a simple HTML layout divided in sections using an aside an a main container. 
The laouyt is responsive using CSS Flexbox properties having display flex in the largest container 
For large or desktop resolutions the flex containers have a flex basis of 70% for the main and 30% for the aside. 
For small resolutions or a max-wdth of 768px I changed the flex direction to column and stacked the containers in a preferred order.

**Current Projects include: **

- Data manipulation excercises using Python.
- Creating a Portfolio Site.
- Making this beautiful CV responsive layout.
- Learning R and data Visualization Tools

...stay tuned.
